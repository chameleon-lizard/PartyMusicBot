# PartyMusicBot

A simple bot to manage music queue during parties. API included, so you can make any frontend that you want! 

# Problem

During parties people often have only one bluetooth speaker and one phone connected to it, but many people with different
choices of music. Organising queue is a real PITA -- so I've made this bot to help me with that.
