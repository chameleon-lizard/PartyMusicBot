# PartyMusicBot

A simple bot to manage music queue during parties. API included, so you can make any frontend that you want! 

# Premise

I love to listen to 70-s rock when I'm drunk, but not everyone loves the same music as I do. In order to keep fighting to a minimum, I decided to create a telegram bot that will manage music queue for you.

# TODO

This is an extremely barebones implementation, so lots of stuff will be added:

- [x] Barebones API.
- [ ] Telegram bot that uses the API.
- [ ] Seeing the song queue through the API and the bot.
- [ ] Pausing and playing.
- [ ] Users and elevated priviliges. All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others - especially if they are the farm's owners.
- [ ] Voting for the next song and priority to songs in the queue.
- [ ] Skipping songs.
- [ ] Hardware - rpi connected to a speaker as a final task.
