# PartyMusicBot

A simple bot to manage music queue during parties. API included, so you can make any frontend that you want! 

# Premise

During parties people often have only one bluetooth speaker and one phone connected to it, but many people with different
choices of music. To minimize fighting for the privilege of listening to your favorite songs, I've decided to create this
bot, which can manage music queue for you.

# TODO

This is an extremely barebones implementation, so lots of stuff will be added:

- [x] Barebones API.
- [x] Telegram bot that uses the API.
- [x] Seeing the song queue through the API and the bot.
- [ ] Pausing and playing.
- [ ] Users and elevated privileges. All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others - especially if they are the farm's owners.
- [ ] Voting for the next song and priority to songs in the queue.
- [ ] Skipping songs.
